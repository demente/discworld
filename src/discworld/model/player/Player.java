		// the board (think of them as your spies).

		// minions in at least eleven different areas.
		// With three players you need to have
		// minions in at least ten different areas.
		// With four players you need to have
		// minions in at least nine different areas.
		// Areas must be free of demons.
		// Lord Selachii, Lord Rust, Lord de Worde – you win if at
		// the beginning of your turn you control a certain number of
		// areas. If there are only two of you playing then you need to
		// control seven areas, if there are three of you then you need to
		// control five areas, and if there are four of you then you need
		// to control four areas. You control an area if you have more
		// playing pieces in it than any single other player (a playing
		// piece being a minion or a building). You would also have to
		// have more pieces there than the total number of trolls in the
		// area. You cannot control an area that contains one or more
		// demons. The presence of a trouble marker does not affect
		// the control of an area.
		// Dragon King of Arms – If at the beginning of your turn
		// there are eight trouble markers on the board then you win.
		// The rationale is that the city has fallen into more chaos than
		// normal and people want the king back (who would be
		// controlled by you).
		// Chrysoprase – If at the beginning of your turn your net worth
		// (your cash plus the monetary cost of each building you have)
		// is $50 or more then you win the game. Please note that any
		// loans you have taken out count as $12 against your total
		// worth (certain cards allow you to take out loans).
		// Commander Vimes – you win if nobody else wins by the
		// time the draw pile has been exhausted.
