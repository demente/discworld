    // Lord Selachii, Lord Rust, Lord de Worde â€“ you win if at
    // the beginning of your turn you control a certain number of
    // areas. If there are only two of you playing then you need to
    // control seven areas, if there are three of you then you need to
    // control five areas, and if there are four of you then you need
    // to control four areas. You control an area if you have more
    // playing pieces in it than any single other player (a playing
    // piece being a minion or a building). You would also have to
    // have more pieces there than the total number of trolls in the
    // area. You cannot control an area that contains one or more
    // demons. The presence of a trouble marker does not affect
    // the control of an area.
